        <h3>Kyria Island</h3>
        <p>
            <paragraph>In the year 2000, several tectonic movements were said to have occurred simultaneously around the entirety of the planet, followed by the discovery of the landmass known today as Kyria. Situated in the northmost side of the Pacific Ocean, this island became a major point of research for many geologists given it's quick and unusal formation far from any tectonic plate and vulcanic activity.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>After the discovery of Nitrin crystals and it's properties by Marlow Vincent and his research team, the US, followed by Japan started sending funding and personnel to populate the island in the hopes of integrating the landmass to their territory. After a few days of conflict, an official agreement was made between the two nations to divide the area of the island into two separate sections, each with their sphere of influence.</paragraph>

                possibility of similar minerals being found in other places around the world. It didn't take long for what are known today as the "families of power" to find their share of new formations in their respective areas of influence.</paragraph>

    <h3>Mineral Poisoning</h3>
    <p>
        <paragraph>It was widely know that Nitrin not only could store large quantities of raw energy, but also release
            a slightly larger amount, effectively generating energy on it's own. However, a fact that not many people
            would share regarding this fact is that the energy released in this processes was extremely radioactive, and
            many tests were conducted outdoors. Because of this, large quantities of radiation would be released over
            time, "poisoning" the island's surface and causing many of it's inhabitants to become ill.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The worst offender, however, was that not all of the new-found mineral deposits had special
            properties alike to Nitrin, but gave their own sets of illnesses regardless. This meant that hostility
            between the families of power - and those who wished to make use of those minerals - would grow to the point of
            outright conflict, resulting in what was called "The armification of the families", meaning families of power would seek and arm themselves with military-grade equipment and weaponry to fight for mineral deposits around the world.</paragraph>
    </p>

    <h3>Nitrin Mutations</h3>
    <p>
        <paragraph>Around the beginning of 2004, hospital pacients diagnosed with mineral poisoning - more specificaly Nitrin poisoning - where reportedly developing mutations in their bodies that provided positive alterations. In some instances, pacients were said to have recovered from illnesses much quicker than the average healthy human, and in others, it was reported that pacients had developed intense cerebral activity, being able to calculate complex mathematical equations much quicker than before. Some children born from afflicted parents were reported to be extremely healthy, despite having a high concentration of Nitrin radiation in their bodies.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>
            The true origins of the "Blind Eye" are still widely unknown, but many government operatives believe that the terrorist group was formed from three members of a larger entity called "The Eye". This terrorist group was known to intercept military convoys, with many of the obtained items being later sold in the black market. [UNFINISHED]

            The Eye was an amalgamation of different groups that operated outside the law in the entirety of the globe, ranging from drug dealers with the "Yellow Eye", human and organ trafickers with the "Red Eye", all the way to ex-covert operatives in the "Black Eye". [UNFINISHED]

    <h3>How the Families came About</h3>
    <p>
        <paragraph>
            While most people would think "family" would mean related by blood, families of power were, in some instances, coaligations of smaller families that in the past gave up on their own names to form a large and influential group of people. It is said that the first formation of these families would  happen way back in medieval times, however historical records say that most of the families of power formed back then ceased to exist, with exception of the Einheld and Yamada families.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Nowadays, families of power have dedicated themselves to a large number of offices, ranging from cosmetic fabrication, R&D, artificial inteligence development, forge operation, tactical operations all the way to the bellic industry.
        </paragraph>
    </p>

    <h3>Ascencion to Power</h3>
    <p>
        <paragraph>
            With the rapid advancement of new-earth mineral research, the groups of families that uncovered those minerals held exclusivity in mining and transporting said products to the outer world. Because of this, these families amassed a large quantity of power and influence inside their respective areas of operation, becoming their own rulers and affecting world affairs under the table. This group of families was also nicknamed "The Nine Great Families", or simply "The Nine".
        </paragraph>
    </p>

    <h3>The Sittings</h3>
    <p>
        <paragraph>
            Shortly after the bombing of Kyria Island by the Core Circle in 2008, the families of power agreed to make a quinquennial public meeting to discuss world events and humanity's direction in the future. With each Sitting, the meeting location is decided between members of three random families, in the hopes of maintaining unbias in the decision.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Regardless of how altruistic the Sittings might sound, however, their primary purpose is to update a hidden scale of social standing amongst the nine families. Around the end of the meeting, the families are required to present at least one major contribution to the world. In the abscense of such thing, the families will usually try and expose a wrongdoing - wich are rather frequent - of another family, most of the time resulting in conflict, but giving positive standing should the accusing family prove enough evidence. Families with higher standing are often granted more credit to their claims and should a delicate situation arise, governments may call upon one of these families to resolve it.
        </paragraph>
    </p>
    <h3>Family Armification</h3>
    <p>
        <paragraph>
            Given the clear advantage some new-earth minerals provided in relation to others, the families of power entered an armed conflict in late 2004 for the rights of utilizing wichever mineral they so wished. Because of the small scale of the Families, their respective governments started secretly funding the armies to offer a bellic advantage.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Upon the discovery of this fact months later by neutral nations, the UN made an official stance of cease-fire, threatening imense fines to wichever family and its parent nation that decided to continue the conflict. Upon discussion within the UN, it was later decided that wichever family that had found the new-earth mineral first would be the one to hold exclusivity until peaceful agreement with the holding family was made.
